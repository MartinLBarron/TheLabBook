# Preface {.unnumbered}

This is book is intended to be the book I wish I had been given when I began managing a social science laboratory.  My goal is write and develop this book openly.  I'll be posting new additions to the book here (as soon as they are in something approaching a reasonable state).  The entire book is available on [github](https://github.com/MartinLBarron/TheLabBook) for anyone interested in downloading, editting, or suggesting addition.  

## About Me

For more than 20 years I've been involved in social science research. I am currently Director of Data and Analysis at the University of Chicago's Crime Lab and Education Lab.
