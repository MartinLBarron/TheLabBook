# Preface {.unnumbered}

This is (intended to be) the book I wish I had when I started managing a social science laboratory.  My goal is develop it in the open.  I'll be posting new additions to the book hear as soon as they are in something approaching a reasonable state.  And the entire book will be to github for anyone to see and comment on.
